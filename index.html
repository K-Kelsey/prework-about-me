      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am but a meer novice in the programming realm, with hope and intentions to hone my coding skills in this new career field I am transitioning into.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Native to the Pacific NorthWest, I was raised in the humble valley of Snohomish, where the cattle grazes to its heart's content and the chickens roost boastfully.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>During my hours of leisure, I enjoy an engaging story by authors of interest, screen time includes video games and a perpetually growing list of movies and shows to watch. As my appetite grows, I will engage in prepaing myself a plate of sensational appeal both visually and aromatically; sufficiently satisfying both apetite and taste. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>With my boarderline addiction to video games, my hopes are to land a postion with a well accredited gaming production company. Few examples of interest being: Blizzard, Valve, EpicGames or Bestheda. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Currently residing in the ever gentrifying city of Lynnwood, WA.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>My ideal position is still left up in the air; what initially caught my attention with computer programming began with the desire to understand the back end of coding and how code infastructure keeps the world wide web operating like a well oiled machine. The other side of the coin being the fact that I love visual creativity and can see myself thriving in the front end aspect of coding as well. Then again, who is to say that I cannot engage in both?</p>
